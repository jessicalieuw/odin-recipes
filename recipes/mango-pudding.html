    <h4>Refreshing and light mango pudding dessert.</h4>
    <p>Mango pudding is best when made with sweet, in-season, perfectly ripe mangos. While you can also make it with thawed frozen mango, we've found that frozen mango can be even more stringy and fibrous than the average fresh mango, so you may end up with less puree after straining. You may also get a less vibrant color!</p>
    <p>This rich and silky mango pudding is bursting with luscious mango flavor. The simplicity of this dessert makes it great for company. It only takes 10 minutes and 5 ingredients to make.</p>
